## Instructions:

    1. To make sugar syrup: Add the sugar, cardamom, and water a wide pan 
       and cook until you get a 1 string consistency, at that point, turn 
       off the stove.

    2. Take a big bowl and add khoa, all purpose flour, and milk and make 
       a nice dough. 
    
    3. Mix the dough without applying force in a gentle manner. 
    
    4. Make small balls out of it. Remember the jamuns will be doubled in 
       size after cooking. 

    5. Now in a frying pan add ghee / oil and heat the oil at low flame and 
       fry the jamuns at a very low flame until they are golden brown. 

    6. Now remove them from oil and dip them in luke warm (or slightly warm) 
       sugar syrup for 4-6 hours. Allow them to cool. 
    
    7. Lastly add rose essence and sprinkle chopped nuts / melon seeds 
       (optional). For best taste, use it the next day.
