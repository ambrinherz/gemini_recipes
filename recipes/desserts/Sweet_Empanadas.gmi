## Step 2: Making filling(Halwa):
 
### Ingredients:

* Chane ki daal(split chickpea lentils)     100 gms
* Almonds                                   50 gms  
* Cashewnuts                                50 gms
* Cardamom powder                           0.25 tsp 
* Kesar powder/saffron (optional)           1 pinch
* Sugar(add more sugar if you like)         0.75 cup
* Ghee                                      3 tablespoons

### Prep:

```
  1. Wash Chane ki daal and boil it in a pressure cooker until you hear a
     whistle(probably around 5 minutes). The lentils should be half boiled 
     by this time. Do not overcook them. Allow the lentils to cool and
     then use a mixer to grind it into a fine paste.

  2. Soak almonds in water(room temperature) overnight or soak them in hot
     water for 10 minutes. Peel the skin of the almonds and grind them in 
     a mixer into a fine paste.

  3. Wash the cashew nuts and grind them in the mixer into a fine paste.

```

### Instructions:

```
   1. Take a pan and add all the above items, i.e., lentil paste, almond
      and cashewnut paste, sugar, cardamom powder, kesar powder and ghee 
      and cook on low flame. keep your face away from the halwa as it
      splatters while stirring,so be careful.

   2. use a plate to partially cover(half way) the pan and stir it slowly
      for about 12 to15 minutes unless you smell the aroma of halwa. Keep 
      stirring all the time otherwise it may burn at the bottom and then 
      switch off the stove.

   3. Allow it to cool.  Make puris(from step 1) and fill it with the halwa.
      Fold the puris into a semi-circular shape and seal the edges eiher
      by pinching the ends with fingers or using a fork to press the edges.

   4. Make sure the edges are sealed properly. Otherwise the filling(halwa) 
      would spill when deep frying them.
    
   5. Once you have sealed the puris, let them rest for about 30 minutes,
      so the moisture dries out. Then deep fry them on medium flame until 
      golden and crispy.

``` 

### Note:

   * Be careful while making the halwa because it keeps bubbling, So keep 
     your face away from the vessel.Take care while frying the puris. 

   * If you could  make the kheer/phirni, you could use it to dip/dunk in
     the puris and together it would be scrumptious.
